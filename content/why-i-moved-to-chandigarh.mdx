If you feel stuck or out of place where you are, and you have the chance, moving can change everything.

I grew up in a small area in West Bengal called Moyna. Life there was simple, and I’m grateful for the memories I made growing up. My family was loving, and I had good friends. But as I got older, I realized something was missing.

I was deeply interested in computers and programming. I loved learning about tech, but where I lived, there wasn’t much opportunity to grow in this field. Most people didn’t share the same interests, and I often felt like I didn’t belong. I kept to myself and spent most of my time tinkering with what little resources I had. It was isolating at times, but it also fueled my passion for learning. Still, I knew that to truly grow, I needed a change.

When the time came for college, I decided to move to Chandigarh to study BCA at Chandigarh University. That decision changed my life. It wasn’t an easy decision to leave my family and the familiar surroundings of Moyna. However, I knew it was necessary to explore new opportunities and push myself out of my comfort zone. I vividly remember the first day I arrived in Chandigarh. The city felt so different from Moyna — bustling, vibrant, and full of possibilities.

For the first time, I felt like I was in a place where people understood my passion. At Chandigarh University, I met others who were just as interested in computers and tech as I was. We shared ideas, collaborated on projects, and inspired each other to learn and grow. It was an environment where I could thrive, and it felt incredible to be surrounded by like-minded individuals who shared my goals and aspirations.

Beyond academics, moving to Chandigarh gave me the opportunity to experience new cultures and meet people from different parts of the country. Each interaction broadened my perspective and taught me something new. I discovered that stepping outside of your comfort zone not only helps you grow professionally but also personally. I learned how to adapt, how to connect with people, and how to embrace challenges as opportunities.

That’s not to say everything was perfect. Moving to a new city comes with its own set of challenges. There were times when I felt homesick or overwhelmed by the fast-paced environment. But each of those moments taught me resilience. They reminded me why I had made this decision in the first place—to build a better future for myself and to pursue my passion wholeheartedly.

I’m not saying Chandigarh is perfect or that moving is the answer for everyone. For some, Moyna might be their perfect place. Everyone has their own journey and their own definition of happiness and fulfillment. But for me, stepping out of my comfort zone and moving to a new city was the best decision I ever made. It gave me the opportunity to grow in ways I never imagined and to become the person I am today.

If you feel like you’re not growing where you are, don’t be afraid to take that leap. Sometimes, a change in environment can open doors you never knew existed. Moving might be challenging, but it can also be the first step toward discovering your true potential and finding a place where you truly belong.
