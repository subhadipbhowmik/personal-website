Ryan Dahl, the creator of Node.js and Deno, has a unique perspective on the JavaScript landscape, having shaped its trajectory in significant ways. In a recent interview, he shared his thoughts on the future of JavaScript, emphasizing adherence to web standards, the importance of TypeScript, and the need for a more unified ecosystem. Let's dive into the key aspects of his vision:

### The Web Browser is the North Star

Dahl's core philosophy revolves around the idea that the **future of JavaScript is inextricably linked to the browser**. He believes that any deviation from browser standards only creates technical debt down the road. This is a key point that he feels was missed with the development of Node.js, where the module system and other aspects diverged from web standards. He sees **the browser as the ultimate standard** for JavaScript, and believes that server-side JavaScript should strive to align with it as closely as possible.

- **ESM is the Way**: Dahl is a firm believer in ECMAScript Modules (ESM) and thinks it's time to leave CommonJS behind. He argues that using anything other than ESM is "working against the specification". While Deno supports importing CommonJS modules for backward compatibility, it is not a recommended approach for developers building new applications.
- **No More Reinventing the Wheel**: Dahl's vision is about creating a server-side JavaScript environment that respects web standards rather than creating a completely separate ecosystem. This means implementing features that are as close as possible to what browsers offer.

### Embracing TypeScript as the Natural Evolution

Dahl sees **TypeScript as the natural way to add types to JavaScript**. He believes that TypeScript makes developers more productive and is very pragmatic. He hopes that the ongoing effort to add type comments to JavaScript will ultimately align with TypeScript syntax.

- **Types are Essential:** He thinks that it is apparent that TypeScript is very useful, and the way to add types to JavaScript, not Flow or any other system.
- **Browsers Will Catch Up**: His hope is that browsers will eventually be able to take TypeScript files and strip out the types for execution. Deno is already taking this leap, allowing developers to program directly in TypeScript.

### A Unified Ecosystem Through JSR

Dahl expresses concerns about the current state of npm, which he describes as a "forgotten corner of Microsoft". He believes the JavaScript ecosystem could be much better. This concern led to the creation of **JSR, a new open-source JavaScript registry** designed to be delightful for both publishers and consumers.

- **JSR's Goals:** JSR aims to be a modern alternative to npm, with features such as autogenerated docs, a "pub score," and security features. It works natively with Deno but also has an npm adapter to be used in Node.js and other environments.
- **Focus on the Developer Experience**: JSR prioritizes ease of use for publishing and consuming packages, especially when dealing with TypeScript.
- **Centralized and Controlled**: Unlike the distributed nature of Deno's original module system, JSR is a centralized registry which prioritizes reliability and stability. It also takes a more active stance on package ownership, preventing squatting and ensuring that well-known scopes belong to their respective organizations.

### A Focus on Practicality

Dahl's vision isn't about chasing the newest trends but rather about creating a stable, reliable, and practical development environment. He thinks that the JavaScript world has suffered from unnecessary complexity.

- **Simplicity is Key**: With Deno, he aims to provide a complete development toolkit in a single executable file, making it easier for newcomers to start. Deno offers built-in tools like code formatting, linting, and type checking, removing the need to install and configure many different tools.
- **Security by Default**: Deno takes a security-first approach by requiring explicit permissions for accessing the file system or network, similar to how browsers handle permissions. This creates a more secure environment by default.
- **The Importance of Standards:** He emphasizes the importance of adhering to specifications and not deviating from them unless absolutely necessary. While specifications can be broken, he believes the module system is something that should remain aligned with standards.
- **Long-Term Thinking**: He believes that JavaScript is "too deeply embedded in humanity" to disappear anytime soon. This long-term perspective guides his decisions about the future of the language.

### Looking Ahead

Dahl is focused on making JavaScript development as smooth and enjoyable as possible. This means continuing to refine the Deno runtime, support for typescript, and push for a more unified ecosystem through projects like JSR. He also seems open to the idea of collaboration with other projects and is carefully watching how the community is evolving. He wants to get the trademark issue around Javascript addressed.

In conclusion, Ryan Dahl's vision for the future of JavaScript centers on aligning with web standards, embracing TypeScript, and making the developer experience as simple and secure as possible. He emphasizes practicality and long-term thinking, aiming to address some of the pain points in the existing JavaScript ecosystem. His work with Deno and JSR reflects these ideas, offering a glimpse into a potential future for JavaScript development.
