Before writing this, I want to clarify that I am not a Punjabi. I am from Tamluk, West Bengal, and I moved to Chandigarh for my B.C.A studies. So, I am an outsider, but Punjab has never made me feel like one.

When I first came here, I had no idea how my experience would be. I had heard about Punjab in school — about its history, its five rivers, and its agriculture. But experiencing Punjab firsthand was something else. In the last two and a half years, I have seen, learned, and felt things that I never expected.

This is not a history lesson or a geography lecture. This is my experience—the things I have felt, the people I have met, and the moments that made me see Punjab in a new light.

## 1. They Are Very Welcoming

One of the first things I noticed when I arrived at Chandigarh University was how the teachers addressed students as _"beta"_. It was something I had never experienced before. Back home, teachers were always formal, but here, they spoke like family members. It felt strange at first, but soon, I realized how comforting it was.

This warmth is not just in universities. Whether in shops, hospitals, or public places, Punjabis talk to you in a way that makes you feel like you belong. I have had shopkeepers call me _"puttar"_, auto drivers give me extra advice like an elder brother, and random strangers help me when I was lost. The people here don’t treat you like an outsider—they make you feel at home.

## 2. They Are Kind

I had heard about _langar_ before, but seeing it in real life was different.

One day, while walking near the market, I saw people setting up a big tent with huge pots of food. I was curious, so I asked someone what was happening. He smiled and said, _"Beta, langar lagaya hai, aao prasad lo!"_ (Son, we have set up a langar, come and have some food!)

That moment stayed with me. I saw how anyone—rich or poor, Hindu or Muslim—could come and eat without hesitation. This wasn’t a one - time event. Every few days, I would see langars set up on roadsides, at Gurdwaras, and even near my PG. Punjabis don’t think twice before feeding a stranger. Their kindness is not just a habit; it is a part of who they are.

## 3. Very Hard-Working People

One thing I will never forget is the sight of farmers working in the fields under the burning 45-degree sun.

I remember sitting in my AC lab, looking out of the window, and seeing them covered in dust, sweating, but still working tirelessly. It made me realize how privileged I was. We complain about small things, but these farmers, who provide food for the entire country, never stop working.

And it’s not just in farming. I have seen shopkeepers opening their stores before sunrise, bus conductors managing long shifts, and street vendors pushing carts from one street to another—all with the same dedication. Punjabis have an energy that never fades, no matter how tough the work is.

## 4. The Craze for Studying Abroad

If you ever come to Punjab, one thing will immediately catch your attention—IELTS coaching centers. They are everywhere.

When I first arrived in Chandigarh, I thought IELTS was just another exam. But soon, I realized that for many Punjabis, it’s more than that. It’s a ticket to Canada, Australia, the UK, or Ireland.

Every student I met had either taken IELTS or was planning to. Visa agencies were on every street, offering consultation services. The dream of going abroad is so deeply rooted here that it feels like a part of life. For many, studying abroad is not just about education—it’s about a better future.

## 5. Deep Respect for Culture & Religion

One of the most beautiful things about Punjab is how deeply people respect their culture and religion.

Visiting a Gurdwara was an experience I will never forget. The peace, the humility, and the feeling of being part of something bigger—it was overwhelming. I saw people serving in the _langar_ not because they had to, but because they genuinely wanted to.

Festivals here are grand. During Guru Nanak Jayanti, the entire city was lit up with lights, and people distributed sweets to strangers on the road. I realized that religion here is not just about prayer; it is about service, love, and community.

## 6. Bravery Runs in Their Blood

One thing I have learned is that Punjabis are not just strong physically, but mentally too.

History speaks of the bravery of Sikh warriors, but even today, I see that same fearless spirit in everyday life. Whether it’s a farmer fighting for his land, a soldier standing at the border, or an ordinary person standing up against injustice—Punjabis never back down.

I have seen this attitude in the way they talk, the way they work, and even in the way they help others. They are the kind of people who will fight for you if they believe you are right.

## 7. A Heaven for Food Lovers

Before coming here, I thought I knew what Punjabi food was. I was so wrong.

I had eaten butter chicken and dal makhani before, but the food here is something else. The variety of parathas blew my mind—_aloo paratha, gobi paratha, paneer paratha, mooli paratha_, and even _cheese paratha_! And they don’t just serve it plain—every paratha comes with a huge chunk of butter on top and a glass of thick _lassi_.

Then there’s _sarson da saag_ with _makki di roti_, the dish that defines Punjab in winter. And how can I forget _chole bhature, amritsari kulcha, rajma chawal_, and _pindi chole_? The food here is not just delicious; it’s made with love. People don’t let you leave unless you’ve eaten more than you can handle!

## 8. Health Consciousness

One thing that truly surprised me in Punjab is how health-conscious people are.

After getting a job in IT Park, Chandigarh, I started going for morning runs near Sukhna Lake, which is just 800m from my PG. Every morning, I am amazed to see people of all ages—from 8-year-old kids to 80-year-old elders—running, doing yoga, and exercising with full energy.

And it’s not just men; women here are equally active and fit. Back home in Bengal, I often joked about how even police officers had a big belly, but in Punjab, fitness is a priority. People here value their health, and it’s something I have started to admire and learn from.

## Final Thoughts

Living in Punjab for the past two and a half years has been an incredible experience. From the warmth of the people to their strong cultural roots, hard work, and generosity, I have learned so much. Punjabis are not just welcoming; they treat everyone like family. Their kindness, bravery, and deep respect for their faith make them truly inspiring.

And of course, their love for food and their dreams of going abroad add to their unique identity.

Punjab has taught me that life is not just about personal success but about community, faith, and hard work. No matter where I go, a part of me will always cherish the essence of Punjab.
