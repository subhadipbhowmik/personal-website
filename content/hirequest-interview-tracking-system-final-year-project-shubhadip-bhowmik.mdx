**Introduction**

Hello, my name is **Shubhadip Bhowmik**, a final-year BCA student (UID: 22BCA10032) at **Chandigarh University**. With the guidance of **Assistant Professor Konika Grover**, I worked on my final-year major project, **_HireQuest_**.

This blog is all about my journey of creating _HireQuest_, a centralized interview tracking system designed to make the recruitment process easier. The project aims to solve common problems faced by both candidates and recruiters when managing interviews.

I wanted to share my experience to explain why I chose this project, how I planned and developed it, and the challenges I faced along the way. Building _HireQuest_ was a learning experience that helped me use my technical skills to solve real-world problems.
