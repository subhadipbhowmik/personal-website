## Introduction

Hello, my name is **Shubhadip Bhowmik**, a final-year BCA student **(UID: 22BCA10032)** at **Chandigarh University**. With the guidance of **Assistant Professor Konika Grover [E13199]**, I worked on my final-year major project, **_HireQuest_**.

![HireQuest - Interview Tracking System](/blog/hire-quest-project.png "Discover HireQuest, a centralized system for managing student interviews and tracking applications.")

This blog is all about my journey of creating _HireQuest_, a **centralized placement management system** designed to make campus recruitment more structured and efficient. The project aims to solve common issues students face during placements, such as **unorganized job notifications, difficulty in tracking applications, and lack of structured updates**.

## What Problem Does _HireQuest_ Solve?

At Chandigarh University, placement updates are primarily shared through **WhatsApp messages**, leading to several issues:

- **Unstructured communication** â€“ Important job details get lost in chat history.
- **Excessive notifications** â€“ Students receive updates for companies they havenâ€™t even applied to.
- **Tracking difficulties** â€“ There's no centralized way to monitor **applied jobs, exam rounds, and placement status**.

These inefficiencies make the placement process frustrating and disorganized for students.

## _HireQuest_: The Solution

_HireQuest_ is designed to **streamline the placement process** by offering:

âœ… **A centralized platform** for students to browse and apply for jobs.  
âœ… **Personalized notifications** only for applied jobs.  
âœ… **Placement tracking** with interview rounds and selection updates.  
âœ… **Admin tools** for placement coordinators to manage job postings and track student applications.

With _HireQuest_, students will no longer need to rely on scattered WhatsApp messages and will have a **structured placement journey**.

## Project Objective

_HireQuest_ aims to:

- **Help students** manage job applications, interview schedules, and placement progress in one place.
- **Assist placement coordinators** in posting jobs, tracking applicants, and managing interview rounds efficiently.
- **Reduce notification clutter** and provide structured, real-time updates.

This system ensures a **seamless hiring workflow** for both students and placement authorities.

## Project Progress & Updates
