### How to Learn Better and Faster as a Software Engineer

The field of software engineering is ever-evolving, where tools and technologies that dominate today might fade into obscurity tomorrow. To remain relevant, software engineers must embrace a culture of continuous learning. Drawing from personal experience, I’ve compiled five key strategies to help you learn more effectively and efficiently.

### 1. **Register Your Curiosity**

Human beings are inherently curious. When you encounter something fascinating—be it a concept, tool, or framework—note it down immediately.

- **Why this works:** Curiosity naturally drives engagement, eliminating the need for external motivation.
- **How to do it:** Use a note-taking app to capture your thoughts. Write not just _what_ intrigued you but _why_. For example:
  - "Learn about cellular automata because the Game of Life was fascinating."
  - "Explore Redis internals after being amazed by its advanced data structures."

Revisit these notes periodically, as this helps you rediscover and act on your initial interests.

### 2. **Jump Start**

Procrastination is the enemy of progress. Rather than waiting for the perfect moment or the best resources, dive in immediately.

- **Key tip:** If you’re starting from scratch, any resource will do. Don’t waste time seeking perfection at this stage.
- **Practical advice:**
  - If you’re learning about a database like CockroachDB, don’t wait to find the ultimate guide. Start with any available documentation or tutorials.
  - Use small, uninterrupted time slices to study instead of waiting for large blocks of free time.

### 3. **Do the Laundry**

We often romanticize learning, imagining the grand outcomes of mastering something new. However, true learning comes from hands-on practice.

- **What this means:** Avoid endless tutorial-watching without implementation.
- **How to implement:**
  - Set up your local or remote IDE (e.g., Replit) and start coding or experimenting.
  - Implement concepts even if it's just the core idea. For instance, after reading a research paper, try coding its central algorithm.
  - Don’t just theorize—practice exposes limitations, strengthens understanding, and builds real-world skills.

---

### 4. **Follow the Inverse Power Law**

Jumping directly into advanced topics might seem exciting but often leads to frustration. Instead, spend significant time on the basics.

- **Why basics matter:** A strong foundation makes it easier to grasp complex ideas.
- **Example:**
  - If you’re curious about how large language models (LLMs) work, start by learning neural networks and calculus.
  - For database internals, understand indexing and ACID properties before exploring advanced optimizations.

---

### 5. **Juggle and Time Box**

Monotony and distractions can derail your learning journey. Combat this by working on multiple topics simultaneously and setting clear time limits.

- **How to juggle:**
  - Select at least two subjects or skills to learn in parallel. If one becomes tedious, switch to the other.
  - For example: Study Go while also exploring Redis.
- **How to time box:**
  - Allocate a specific timeframe to each topic. For instance, dedicate three months to learn Go and evaluate your progress after one month.
  - Recognize when to quit if something isn’t aligning with your interests or goals.

### Conclusion

By applying these strategies, you can supercharge your learning and growth as a software engineer:

1. **Register Your Curiosity:** Capture and revisit intriguing ideas.
2. **Jump Start:** Act now, worry about perfection later.
3. **Do the Laundry:** Prioritize implementation over endless theory.
4. **Follow the Inverse Power Law:** Build a solid foundation before tackling advanced topics.
5. **Juggle and Time Box:** Avoid burnout and distractions by diversifying your focus and setting limits.

Continuous learning doesn’t just keep you relevant—it helps you grow into a better engineer every single day.
