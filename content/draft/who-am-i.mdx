That is really a tricky question. I can say I am a Software Developer, but that's my job. I can say I am an obedient son, but that is my relationship with my parents. I can say I am a technical blog writer, but that's my side hustle.

I am much more than my hobby, job, side-hustle and relationships. Or maybe I am all of them. But the best way to describe me is Shubhadip Bhowmik.(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qP2oSpIA&ab_channel=RottenTomatoesTrailers)

Enough with the theatrics. Here is what you should know about me:

- Born in Tamluk, West Bengal; High School in West Bengal; UUnder - graduation from Chandigarh University; Currently Working in NY Softech India
