Dear God,

How have you been? I am doing great, hope you are sailing on the same boat. I know you are too busy, but I am writing this to you with the hope that you will read it someday.

This letter might have muddled you with a bunch of thoughts, just like I often am. I don’t even know the purpose of writing this, but sometimes all we humans need is to be heard, and you, the one ruling the universe, seem the best to address it to.

Let me start by saying **thank you**. Life has been a roller coaster, and maybe that’s because we humans tend to take unadorned things for granted. You sprinkled in a pinch of troubles, grief, separations, and those moments where everything feels like it's falling apart. But here I am with a smile on my face, and the reason is **you**. Thank you for the little and magnificent things you've given me: a loving family, unbreakable friendships, countless smiles and giggles, and most importantly, _me_. I can never thank you enough for blessing me with myself.

Honestly, there’s so much to be grateful for, but we often choose to focus on the things we’re deprived of. I know you will forgive me, though—that’s the difference between you and us.

I'll close this letter with a prayer I used to recite as a child but forgot as I grew older:

> “Thank you, God, for the food we eat,  
> Thank you, God, for the world so sweet.  
> Thank you, God, for the birds that sing,  
> Thank you, God, for everything.”

Waiting for your reply.

**With Love,  
Your favorite child**
