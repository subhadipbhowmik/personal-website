## Project Setup

To follow this blog, you need some project prerequisites:

## Frontend Setup

For this tutorial, I am reusing React as the frontend library, and for styling, I have used Tailwind CSS. Now click on the client folder and open the terminal. To install React, run this command:

function HelloWorld() {
  return <div>Hello, World!</div>;
}
```
